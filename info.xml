  <name>quick lookup for the autocomplete in the navigation</name>
  <description>
This extension improves the default search in several ways:
- more efficient and faster requests
- search in the start of the names not in the middle (first or last).
- adjust the queries based on the number of results. The aim is to provide the most relevant results at the top, all the time
- you can enter the contact id and it will go directly to the contact page

Just try it, you will like it;)

Current limitations: 
- the result only includes the name and email. The address and phones are skipped for performance reasons. Shouldn't be too complicated to add them
- the query always searches all the contacts and ignores ACL.
